                                <h2>RSS Is Nice</h2>
                                    <p>This past week I added <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> to my blog! Here I'll talk about the process of doing that, my rediscovery of how nice RSS is, and some music blogs I've been enjoying. If you want to follow my blog, <a href="https://reillyspitzfaden.com/blog/feed.xml">here's the link</a>.</p>
                                    <h3>RSS for my Blog</h3>
                                    <p>I started out by trying to make my blog automatically generate the RSS feed — all I would have to do is upload the files to Netlify as I normally do. The first place I looked was at this <a href="https://www.contentful.com/blog/generate-blog-rss-feed-with-javascript-and-netlify/">article</a>, with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom">jsdom</a> NPM package to handle parsing my HTML files where this post used <a href="https://www.contentful.com/about-us/">Contentful</a>'s built-in system. As I tried this and some related avenues out, I became unhappy with the number of steps involved, and auto-generating started to feel like more work than simply hand-writing an XML file.</p>
                                    <p>When I looked into it, I found that hand-writing an RSS XML file was even easier than I assumed, and didn't hinder my wanting to make new posts. The <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">RSS specification</a> is all clearly laid out, and the official page includes <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#sampleFiles">sample files</a> for v0.91, v0.92, and v2.0. My current system is that I have a <a href="https://github.com/reillypascal/personalsite/blob/main/reillyspitzfaden/blog/templates/template.xml">template</a> in my site files, and I can copy/paste the <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> section into the main feed file and fill in the blanks.</p>
                                    <p>This method is still a little "rough-and-ready," what with the copy-pasting, but the important thing for me is that it <em>works</em>. After seeing Molly White <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@molly0xfff/111960696197094015">mention</a> it, I have been eyeing the IndieWeb wiki's discussion of <a href="https://indieweb.org/content_management_system#Why_write_your_own">making your own CMS</a>, and I may try improving my system with something like that — not integrated with Netlify, but I could run a homemade static site generator before uploading my files. My best guess so far is I could use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss">rss</a> NPM package as one way of handing the RSS part of a CMS, but if people have suggested tools, I would love to hear about them!</p>
                                    <p>Side note: one final tweak I did outside of RSS is adding a typographical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_%28typography%29">asterism</a> to my blog posts, inspired by jamesg's recent "<a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/">100 things you can do with your personal website</a>" post.</p>
                                    <h3>Why RSS</h3>
                                    <p>For a while I would follow news outlets on social media and look for stories there, but I've found that this makes using social media feel like playing Russian roulette — I never know if I'm going to see something funny a friend posted, some cool new music, or an atrocity I have no control over. Separating out my news so I have more choice over what to read and when means I'm much less anxious, while still staying engaged with what's going on around me.</p>
                                    <p>In addition to giving me more control over what I see and when, and helping me keep track of a large number of sites, one thing I especially like is how clean the interface can be, and how I get to decide how it looks. I use <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NewNewsWire</a>, and when I open an article, it's just text and maybe a few images, and everything is formatted the same. The list of articles too — articles are linearly organized, rather than scattered around the page. The whole experience feels much quieter and more relaxed.</p>
                                    <h3>Favorite Blogs</h3>
                                    <p>I follow a variety of things, but one area that's been especially nice is experimental music. I spent the past year or two listening to mostly the same music (such as <a href="https://autechre.bandcamp.com/album/draft-730">Autechre</a>, <a href="https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/album/rainbow-bridge">Fire-Toolz</a>, and <a href="https://magdalenabay.bandcamp.com/album/mercurial-world">Magdalena Bay</a>), but being in Fediverse/IndieWeb circles, I've stumbled onto a bunch of blogs and artists that give me a huge amount of new music to explore. It took me a bit of time in these circles, but when I found the first few blogs or artists, I came across countless others in rapid succession, often as a result of previous blogs or artists. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><a href="https://acloserlisten.com/">a closer listen</a><ul>
                                    <li>This site focuses on instrumental album reviews. I appreciate that the <a href="https://acloserlisten.com/staff/">writers</a> are numerous and prolific — I get reviews in my inbox every day.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a href="https://avantmusicnews.com/">Avant Music News</a><ul>
                                    <li>AMN has been a particularly helpful jumping-off point. They do a mixture of their own reviews and sharing reviews from other sites. They describe themselves as covering music that's "challenging, interesting, different, progressive, introspective, or just plain weird" — exactly what I like to hear.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a href="http://www.onthefringesofsound.com/">Fringes of Sound</a><ul>
                                    <li>A blog that covers "independent experimental, ambient, noise, and other music that falls well outside the mainstream." I haven't been able to find out as much as some of the others, but the Instagram page lists just one person, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lars_haur/">Lars Haur</a>, so this may be a single-person project.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a href="https://www.outsidenoise.org/reviews/">Outside Noise</a><ul>
                                    <li>I had known about this blog for a while, but I found that keeping my news and blogs in a bookmarks folder and having to repeatedly check to see if anything new was posted discouraged me from reading. I also find managing bookmarks on my phone to be especially irritating, and unfortunately, if I don't have something on my phone I'm less likely to check it.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a href="https://yeahiknowitsucks.wordpress.com/">Yeah I Know It Sucks</a><ul>
                                    <li>This one I had actually encountered back in 2018 when they did a <a href="https://yeahiknowitsucks.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/how-things-are-made-with-reilly-spitzfaden-jamie-vandermolen-maurice-rickard-and-an-eel/">review</a> of an album that included one of my pieces! I was reminded of the blog when another blog (I feel like it was AMN, but I can't find the post) linked to a review by Yeah I Know It Sucks, and I saw that they have continued regular coverage of interesting music.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                                    <p>That's all for today! I'm looking at adding some new features to my site (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention">Webmentions</a> are high on my list), and I'm continuing to do sound design and composition. When I get more interesting sounds made or site features added, I'll definitely do a writeup of those here as well.</p>
                                    <p>I've also been getting back into reading for fun, now that I'm out of school (finished my composition PhD in 2022), and I may discuss some of the books I'm reading. I recently got "<a href="http://www.kristengallerneaux.com/high-static-dead-lines">High Static; Dead Lines</a>" by Kristen Gallerneaux, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves">House of Leaves</a>" by Mark Z. Danielewski, and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_How_They_Tell_Me_the_World_Ends">This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends</a>" by Nicole Perlroth, and I'm excited for all of them.</p>
